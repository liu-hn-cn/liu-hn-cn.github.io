So I believe: it's OK to take screenshots for technical reference.

If you disagree, please:
 * Email liuzhiyong@email.com - it's quite easy to remove/change/replace items, and I don't want to get into trouble(it should take less than 48 hours to remove items in question).
 * If you believe such little screenshots have caused significant damage, you can sue me: my name is Liu Zhiyong(before 2009, I was known as Liu Dieyu), and I'm a Chinese citizen living in China.
